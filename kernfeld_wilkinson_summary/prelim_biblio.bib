@article{protein_interaction,
	Abstract = {We develop a simple but rigorous model of protein--protein association kinetics based on diffusional association on free energy landscapes obtained by sampling configurations within and surrounding the native complex binding funnels. Guided by results obtained on exactly solvable model problems, we transform the problem of diffusion in a potential into free diffusion in the presence of an absorbing zone spanning the entrance to the binding funnel. The free diffusion problem is solved using a recently derived analytic expression for the rate of association of asymmetrically oriented molecules. Despite the required high steric specificity and the absence of long-range attractive interactions, the computed rates are typically on the order of 10(4)--10(6) M(−1) sec(−1), several orders of magnitude higher than rates obtained using a purely probabilistic model in which the association rate for free diffusion of uniformly reactive molecules is multiplied by the probability of a correct alignment of the two partners in a random collision. As the association rates of many protein--protein complexes are also in the 10(5)--10(6) M(−1) sec(−1) range, our results suggest that free energy barriers arising from desolvation and/or side-chain freezing during complex formation or increased ruggedness within the binding funnel, which are completely neglected in our simple diffusional model, do not contribute significantly to the dynamics of protein--protein association. The transparent physical interpretation of our approach that computes association rates directly from the size and geometry of protein--protein binding funnels makes it a useful complement to Brownian dynamics simulations.},

@article{Gelman:1999fk,
	Abstract = {Maps are frequently used to display spatial distributions of parameters of interest, such as cancer rates or average pollutant concentrations by county. It is well known that plotting observed rates can have serious drawbacks when sample sizes vary by area, since very high (and low) observed rates are found disproportionately in poorly-sampled areas. Unfortunately, adjusting the observed rates to account for the effects of small-sample noise can introduce an opposite effect, in which the highest adjusted rates tend to be found disproportionately in well-sampled areas. In either case, the maps can be difficult to interpret because the display of spatial variation in the underlying parameters of interest is confounded with spatial variation in sample sizes. As a result, spatial patterns occur in adjusted rates even if there is no spatial structure in the underlying parameters of interest, and adjusted rates tend to look too uniform in areas with little data. We introduce two models (normal and Poisson) in which parameters of interest have no spatial patterns, and demonstrate the existence of spatial artefacts in inference from these models. We also discuss spatial models and the extent to which they are subject to the same artefacts. We present examples from Bayesian modelling, but, as we explain, the artefacts occur generally.},

Wilkinson*School of Mathematics and Statistics, Newcastle University, Merz Court, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 7RU, UK↵*Author for correspondence (d.j.wilkinson{\{}at{\}}ncl.ac.uk).Abstract Computational systems biology is concerned with the development of detailed mechanistic models of biological processes. Such models are often stochastic and analytically intractable, containing uncertain parameters that must be estimated from time course data. In this article, we consider the task of inferring the parameters of a stochastic kinetic model defined as a Markov (jump) process. Inference for the parameters of complex nonlinear multivariate stochastic process models is a challenging problem, but we find here that algorithms based on particle Markov chain Monte Carlo turn out to be a very effective computationally intensive approach to the problem. Approximations to the inferential model based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are considered, as well as improvements to the inference scheme that exploit the SDE structure. We apply the methodology to a Lotka--Volterra system and a prokaryotic auto-regulatory network. chemical Langevin equationMarkov jump processpseudo-marginal approachsequential Monte Carlostochastic differential equationstochastic kinetic modelFootnotesOne contribution of 9 to a Theme Issue `Inference in complex systems'.Received May 19, 2011.Accepted September 6, 2011.This journal is {\copyright} 2011 The Royal Society},

	Abstract = {SHARE is a unique panel database of micro data on health, socio-economic status and social and family networks covering most of the European Union and Israel. To date, SHARE has collected three panel waves (2004, 2006, 2010) of current living circumstances and retrospective life histories (2008, SHARELIFE); 6 additional waves are planned until 2024. The more than 150 000 interviews give a broad picture of life after the age of 50 years, measuring physical and mental health, economic and non-economic activities, income and wealth, transfers of time and money within and outside the family as well as life satisfaction and well-being. The data are available to the scientific community free of charge at www.share-project.org after registration. SHARE is harmonized with the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) and has become a role model for several ageing surveys worldwide. SHARE's scientific power is based on its panel design that grasps the dynamic character of the ageing process, its multidisciplinary approach that delivers the full picture of individual and societal ageing, and its cross-nationally ex-ante harmonized design that permits international comparisons of health, economic and social outcomes in Europe and the USA.},

   If an outbreak is sufficiently large, stochastic effects are negligible

   accommodate age-of-infection effects. We avoid the use of partial

	Abstract = {In this article, we accomplish two things. First, we show that despite empirical psychologists' nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (</= .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.},

	Abstract = {The article discusses whether the health consequences of obesity are as dire as some health officials claim. Could it be that excess fat is not, by itself, a serious health risk for the vast majority of people who are overweight or obese--categories that in the U.S. include about six of every 10 adults? An increasing number of scholars have begun accusing obesity experts, public health officials and the media of exaggerating the health effects of the epidemic of overweight and obesity. The charges appear in a recent flurry of scholarly books, including "The Obesity Myth," by Paul F. Campos; "The Obesity Epidemic: Science, Morality and Ideology," by Michael Gard and Jan Wright; and "Obesity: The Making of an American Epidemic," by J. Eric Oliver. All can agree that severe obesity greatly increases the risk of numerous diseases, but that form of obesity, in which the body mass index exceeds 40, affects only about one in 12 of the roughly 130 million American adults who set scales spinning above the "healthy" range. It is through type 2 diabetes that obesity seems to pose the biggest threat to public health. Yet the critics dispute claims that diabetes is soaring, that obesity is the cause, and that weight loss is the solution.  INSET: Mortal Mistakes.},

	Abstract = {Obesity has reached global epidemic proportions in both adults and children and is associated with numerous comorbidities, including hypertension (HTN), type II diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea and sleep-disordered breathing, certain cancers, and major cardiovascular (CV) diseases. Because of its maladaptive effects on various CV risk factors and its adverse effects on CV structure and function, obesity has a major impact on CV diseases, such as heart failure (HF), coronary heart disease (CHD), sudden cardiac death, and atrial fibrillation, and is associated with reduced overall survival. Despite this adverse association, numerous studies have documented an obesity paradox in which overweight and obese people with established CV disease, including HTN, HF, CHD, and peripheral arterial disease, have a better prognosis compared with nonoverweight/nonobese patients. This review summarizes the adverse effects of obesity on CV disease risk factors and its role in the pathogenesis of various CV diseases, reviews the obesity paradox and potential explanations for these puzzling data, and concludes with a discussion regarding the current state of weight reduction in the prevention and treatment of CV diseases.},

@article{correl_stoch_cell_model,
	Abstract = {{During an adaptive immune response, lymphocytes proliferate for five to
   twenty-five cell divisions, then stop and die over a period of weeks.
   Based on extensive flow cytometry data, Hawkins et al. (Proc Natl Acad
   Sci USA 104:5032-5037, 2007) introduced a cell-level stochastic model of
   lymphocyte population dynamics, called the Cyton Model, that accurately
   captures mean lymphocyte population size as a function of time. In
   Subramanian et al. (J Math Biol 56(6):861-892, 2008), we performed a
   branching process analysis of the Cyton Model and deduced from
   parameterizations for in vitro and in vivo data that the immune response
   is predictable despite each cell's fate being highly variable. One
   drawback of flow cytometry data is that individual cells cannot be
   tracked, so that it is not possible to investigate dependencies in the
   fate of cells within family trees. In the absence of this information,
   while the Cyton Model abandons one of the usual assumptions of branching
   processes (the independence of lifetime and progeny number), it adopts
   another of the standard branching processes hypotheses: that the fates
   of progeny are stochastically independent. However, new experimental
   observations of lymphocytes show that the fates of cells in the same
   family tree are not stochastically independent. Hawkins et al. (2008,
   submitted) report on cin, lapse photography experiments where every
   founding cell's family tree is recorded for a system of proliferating
   lymphocytes responding to a mitogenic stimulus. Data from these
   experiments demonstrate that the death-or-division fates of collaterally
   consanguineous cells (those in the same generation within a founding
   cell's family tree) are strongly correlated, while there is little
   correlation between cells of distinct generations and between cells in
   distinct family trees. As this finding contrasts with one of the
   assumptions of the Cyton Model, in this paper we introduce three
   variants of the Cyton Model with increasing levels of collaterally
   consanguineous correlation structure to incorporate these new found
   dependencies. We investigate their impact on the predicted expected
   variability of cell population size. Mathematically we conclude that
   while the introduction of correlation structure leaves the mean
   population size unchanged from the Cyton Model, the variance of the
   population size distribution is typically larger. Biologically, through
   comparison of model predictions for Cyton Model parameterizations
   determined by in vitro and in vivo experiments, we deduce that if
   collaterally consanguineous correlation extends beyond cousins, then the
   immune response is less predictable than would be concluded from the
   original Cyton Model. That is, some of the variability seen in data that
   we previously attributed to experimental error could be due to intrinsic
   variability in the cell population size dynamics.}},

	Abstract = {Latent class regression models relate covariates and latent constructs such as psychiatric disorders. Though full maximum likelihood estimation is available, estimation is often in three steps: (i) a latent class model is fitted without covariates; (ii) latent class scores are predicted; and (iii) the scores are regressed on covariates. We propose a new method for predicting class scores that, in contrast to posterior probability-based methods, yields consistent estimators of the parameters in the third step. Additionally, in simulation studies the new methodology exhibited only a minor loss of efficiency. Finally, the new and the posterior probability-based methods are compared in an analysis of mobility/exercise.},

	Abstract = {Many stochastic simulation approaches for generating observations from a posterior distribution depend on knowing a likelihood function. However, for many complex probability models, such likelihoods are either impossible or computationally prohibitive to obtain. Here we present a Markov chain Monte Carlo method for generating observations from a posterior distribution without the use of likelihoods. It can also be used in frequentist applications, in particular for maximum-likelihood estimation. The approach is illustrated by an example of ancestral inference in population genetics. A number of open problems are highlighted in the discussion.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To classify healthy and glaucomatous eyes using relevance vector machine (RVM) and support vector machine (SVM) learning classifiers trained on retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measurements obtained by scanning laser polarimetry (SLP). METHODS: Seventy-two eyes of 72 healthy control subjects (average age = 64.3 +/- 8.8 years, visual field mean deviation = -0.71 +/- 1.2 dB) and 92 eyes of 92 patients with glaucoma (average age = 66.9 +/- 8.9 years, visual field mean deviation = -5.32 +/- 4.0 dB) were imaged with SLP with variable corneal compensation (GDx VCC; Laser Diagnostic Technologies, San Diego, CA). RVM and SVM learning classifiers were trained and tested on SLP-determined RNFL thickness measurements from 14 standard parameters and 64 sectors (approximately 5.6 degrees each) obtained in the circumpapillary area under the instrument-defined measurement ellipse (total 78 parameters). Ten-fold cross-validation was used to train and test RVM and SVM classifiers on unique subsets of the full 164-eye data set and areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for the classification of eyes in the test set were generated. AUROC curve results from RVM and SVM were compared to those for 14 SLP software-generated global and regional RNFL thickness parameters. Also reported was the AUROC curve for the GDx VCC software-generated nerve fiber indicator (NFI). RESULTS: The AUROC curves for RVM and SVM were 0.90 and 0.91, respectively, and increased to 0.93 and 0.94 when the training sets were optimized with sequential forward and backward selection (resulting in reduced dimensional data sets). AUROC curves for optimized RVM and SVM were significantly larger than those for all individual SLP parameters. The AUROC curve for the NFI was 0.87. CONCLUSIONS: Results from RVM and SVM trained on SLP RNFL thickness measurements are similar and provide accurate classification of glaucomatous and healthy eyes. RVM may be preferable to SVM, because it provides a Bayesian-derived probability of glaucoma as an output. These results suggest that these machine learning classifiers show good potential for glaucoma diagnosis.},

@article{SVM_RVM_SMLR_images,
	Abstract = {The accuracy of a conventional supervised classification is in part a function of the training set used, notably impacted by the quantity and quality of the training cases. Since it can be costly to acquire a large number of high quality training cases, recent research has focused on methods that allow accurate classification from small training sets. Previous work has shown the potential of support vector machine (SVM) based classifiers. Here, the potential of the relevance vector machine (RVM) and sparse multinominal logistic regression (SMLR) approaches is evaluated relative to SVM classification. With both airborne and spaceborne multispectral data sets, the RVM and SMLR were able to derive classifications of similar accuracy to the SVM but required considerably fewer training cases. For example, from a training set comprising 600 cases acquired with a conventional stratified random sampling design from an airborne thematic mapper (ATM) data set, the RVM produced the most accurate classification, 93.75%, and needed only 7.33% of the available training cases. In comparison, the SVM yielded a classification that had an accuracy of 92.50% and needed 4.5 times more useful training cases. Similarly, with a Landsat ETM+ (Littleport, Cambridgeshire, UK) data set, the SVM required 4.0 times more useful training cases than the RVM. For each data set, however, the classifications derived by each classifier were of similar magnitude, differing by no more than 1.25%. Finally, for both the ATM and ETM+ (Littleport) data sets, the useful training cases by SVM and RVM had distinct and potentially predictable characteristics. Support vectors were generally atypical but lay in the boundary region between classes in feature space while the relevance vectors were atypical but anti-boundary in nature. The SMLR also tended to mostly, but not always, use extreme cases that lay away from class boundary. The results, therefore, suggest a potential to design classifier-specific intelli- ent training data acquisition activities for accurate classification from small training sets, especially with the SVM and RVM.},

	Abstract = {In null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), p values are judged relative to an arbitrary threshold for significance (.05). The present work examined whether that standard influences the distribution of p values reported in the psychology literature. We examined a large subset of papers from three highly regarded journals. Distributions of p were found to be similar across the different journals. Moreover, p values were much more common immediately below .05 than would be expected based on the number of p values occurring in other ranges. This prevalence of p values just below the arbitrary criterion for significance was observed in all three journals. We discuss potential sources of this pattern, including publication bias and researcher degrees of freedom.},

	Abstract = {K-means clustering is a widely used tool for cluster analysis due to its conceptual simplicity and computational efficiency. However, its performance can be distorted when clustering high-dimensional data where the number of variables becomes relatively large and many of them may contain no information about the clustering structure. This article proposes a high-dimensional cluster analysis method via regularized k-means clustering, which can simultaneously cluster similar observations and eliminate redundant variables. The key idea is to formulate the k-means clustering in a form of regularization, with an adaptive group lasso penalty term on cluster centers. In order to optimally balance the trade-off between the clustering model fitting and sparsity, a selection criterion based on clustering stability is developed. The asymptotic estimation and selection consistency of the regularized k-means clustering with diverging dimension is established. The effectiveness of the regularized k-means clustering is also demonstrated through a variety of numerical experiments as well as applications to two gene microarray examples. The regularized clustering framework can also be extended to the general model-based clustering.},

A Laplace-type operator is constructed on the data set of projections, and the eigenvectors of this operator reveal the projection orientations.

Such a reconstruction algorithm is desirable for the structuring of certain biological proteins using cryo-electron microscopy.},

	Abstract = {Mining patterns in graphs has become an important issue in real applications, such as bioinformatics and web mining. We address a graph clustering problem where a cluster is a set of densely connected nodes, under a practical setting that 1) the input is multiple graphs which share a set of nodes but have different edges and 2) a true cluster cannot be found in all given graphs. For this problem, we propose a probabilistic generative model and a robust learning scheme based on variational Bayesian estimation. A key feature of our probabilistic framework is that not only nodes but also given graphs can be clustered at the same time, allowing our model to capture clusters found in only part of all given graphs. We empirically evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed framework on not only a variety of synthetic graphs but also real gene networks, demonstrating that our proposed approach can improve the clustering performance of competing methods in both synthetic and real data.},

Our results extend previous conclusions that recent Northern Hemisphere surface temperature increases are likely anomalous in a long-term context. Recent warmth appears anomalous for at least the past 1,300 years whether or not tree-ring data are used. If tree-ring data are used, the conclusion can be extended to at least the past 1,700 years, but with additional strong caveats. The reconstructed amplitude of change over past centuries is greater than hitherto reported, with somewhat greater Medieval warmth in the Northern Hemisphere, albeit still not reaching recent levels.},

However, different models differ substantially in their projections, which raises the question of how the different models can best be combined into a probability distribution of future climate change. For this analysis, we have collected both current and future projected mean temperatures produced by nine climate models for 22 regions of the earth. We also have estimates of current mean temperatures from actual observations, together with standard errors, that can be used to calibrate the climate models. We propose a Bayesian analysis that allows us to combine the different climate models into a posterior distribution of future temperature increase, for each of the 22 regions, while allowing for the different climate models to have different variances. Two versions of the analysis are proposed: a univariate analysis in which each region is analyzed separately, and a multivariate analysis in which the 22 regions are combined into an overall statistical model. A cross-validation approach is proposed to confirm the reasonableness of our Bayesian predictive distributions. The results of this analysis allow for a quantification of the uncertainty of climate model projections as a Bayesian posterior distribution, substantially extending previous approaches to uncertainty in climate models.},

Two versions of the analysis are proposed: a univariate analysis in which each region is analyzed separately, and a multivariate analysis in which the 22 regions are combined into an overall statistical model. A cross-validation approach is proposed to confirm the reasonableness of our Bayesian predictive distributions. The results of this analysis allow for a quantification of the uncertainty of climate model projections as a Bayesian posterior distribution, substantially extending previous approaches to uncertainty in climate models.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of climate change in its full richness requires the knowledge of long temperature time series. Although long-term, widely distributed temperature observations are not available, there are other forms of data, known as climate proxies, that can have a statistical relationship with temperatures and have been used to infer temperatures in the past before direct measurements. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to reconstruct past temperatures that integrates information from different sources, such as proxies with different temporal resolution and forcings acting as the external drivers of large scale temperature evolution. Additionally, this method allows us to quantify the uncertainty of the reconstruction in a rigorous manner. The reconstruction method is assessed, using a global climate model as the true climate system and with synthetic proxy data derived from the simulation. The target is to reconstruct Northern Hemisphere temperature from proxies that mimic the sampling and errors from tree ring measurements, pollen indices, and borehole temperatures. The forcing series used as covariates are solar irradiance, volcanic aerosols, and greenhouse gas concentrations. The Bayesian model was successful in integrating these different sources of information in creating a coherent reconstruction. Within the context of this numerical testbed, a statistical process model that includes the external forcings can improve the quality of a hemispheric reconstruction when long time scale proxy information is not available.

	Abstract = {There has been a sustained need to quantify past climate changes from proxy records to better understand the driving mechanisms and thus to improve the prediction of the future. Transfer function is an intuitive and frequently used method in this regard. However, this method is unable to provide interpretive and predictive results from proxy records, because physical processes are not included. The inverse proxy modelling method opened up a new avenue for quantitative palaeoclimate reconstructions through the integration of proxy records with deterministic models. It is fundamentally different from the statistical approach, representing a conceptual advance in quantitative palaeoclimatology. Here we demonstrate the potential of this method by placing a mechanistic model and a 6000 year long peat cellulose δ18O record obtained from the high-cold and monsoonal eastern Tibetan Plateau (c. 3500 m a.s.l.) in a Bayesian paradigm. In this worked example, the marginal posterior probability distributions of palaeoclimate variables such as the δ18O of soil water, temperature, and relative humidity were inferred jointly through the solution to an ill-posed inverse problem using the Markov chain-Monte Carlo method. Our results indicate that the observed variation of the peat cellulose δ18O record in this monsoonal area essentially reflects the changes in the oxygen isotopic composition of soil water, which is closely linked to that of rainfall. Compared with hydrology, temperature and humidity have little influence on the oxygen isotope fractionation of leaf water.},

	Url = {http://hol.sagepub.com/content/23/11/1507.abstract N2 - There has been an increasing need to reconstruct past climate from proxy records quantitatively and mechanistically. The inverse proxy modeling method stands out as a novel approach to quantitative palaeoclimate reconstructions through integrating process-based models and proxy records, representing a major progress in quantitative palaeoclimatology. It has been proposed to incorporate multiple proxy records to produce a more robust constraint on the climate parameters sought for estimation, and most of the work has been conducted using pollen records in conjunction with vegetation models. Here, I show a worked example of using paired stable oxygen and carbon isotope records of peat cellulose from one single core to infer the climate history in NE China for the last 6000 years through solving a well-posed inverse problem using Bayesian statistics. The quantitative palaeoclimate data obtained in this study may deepen our insight into the dynamics of the East Asian summer monsoon. Mean growing season temperature and relative humidity show millennial-scale fluctuations prior to c. 4000 cal. yr BP; thereafter, centennial-scale fluctuations prevailed, revealing the relative importance of solar activity over tropical ocean–atmosphere interactions in regulating the variability of regional climate during the late Holocene. It appears that there was a prominent out-of-phase relationship between temperature and relative humidity, due probably to the different response of these climate elements to orbital forcing and land cover. This worked example demonstrates the potential of using model–data fusion techniques to produce physically meaningful, mathematically optimal, and geologically sound results.},

In nearly all cases our approach meets or exceeds previous parameters, while introducing substantial generality. We apply spectral techniques, using foremost the observation that in all of these problems, the expected adjacency matrix is a low rank matrix wherein the structure of the solution is evident.},

	Abstract = {Consistency is a key property of all statistical procedures analyzing randomly sampled data. Surprisingly, despite decades of work, little is known about consistency of most clustering algorithms. In this paper we investigate consistency of the popular family of spectral clustering algorithms, which clusters the data with the help of eigenvectors of graph Laplacian matrices. We develop new methods to establish that, for increasing sample size, those eigenvectors converge to the eigenvectors of certain limit operators. As a result, we can prove that one of the two major classes of spectral clustering (normalized clustering) converges under very general conditions, while the other (unnormalized clustering) is only consistent under strong additional assumptions, which are not always satisfied in real data. We conclude that our analysis provides strong evidence for the superiority of normalized spectral clustering.},

Despite significant research progress in this area, few attempts have been made to establish the connections between various factorization methods while highlighting their differences. In this paper we aim to provide a comprehensive study on matrix factorization for clustering. In particular, we present an overview and summary on various matrix factorization algorithms and theoretically analyze the relationships among them. Experiments are also conducted to empirically evaluate and compare various factorization methods.

	Abstract = {Automatic seizure detection is becoming popular in modern epilepsy monitoring units since it assists diagnostic monitoring and reduces manual review of large volumes of EEG recordings. In this paper, we describe the application of machine learning algorithms for building patient-specific seizure detectors on multiple frequency bands of intra-cranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recorded by a dense Micro-Electrode Array (MEA). The MEA is capable of recording at a very high sampling rate (30 KHz) producing an avalanche of time series data. We explore subsets of this data to build seizure detectors - we discuss several methods for extracting univariate and bivariate features from the channels and study the effectiveness of using high dimensional clustering algorithms such as K-means and Subspace clustering for constructing the model. Future work involves design of more robust seizure detectors using other features and non-parametric clustering techniques, detection of artifacts and understanding the generalization properties of the models.},

@article{1001967,
	Abstract = {A method is described to incorporate the spatiotemporal noise covariance matrix into a spatiotemporal source analysis. The essential feature is that the estimation problem is split into two parts. First, a model is fitted to the observed noise covariance matrix. This model is a Kronecker product of a spatial and a temporal matrix. The spatial matrix models the spatial covariances by a function dependent on sensor distance. The temporal matrix models the temporal covariances as lag dependent. In the second part, sources are estimated given this noise model, which can be done very efficiently due to the Kronecker formulation. An application to real electroencephalogram (EEG) data shows that the noise model fits the data very well. Simulation results show that the resulting source estimates are more precise than those obtained from a standard analysis neglecting the noise covariance. In addition, the estimated standard errors of the source parameter estimates are far more precise than those obtained from a standard analysis. Finally, the source parameter standard errors are used to investigate the effects of temporal sampling. It is shown that increasing the sampling by a factor x, decreases the standard errors of all source parameters with the square root of x.},

	Abstract = { In this article we consider a set of t repeated measurements on p variables (or characteristics) on each of the n individuals. Thus, data on each individual is a p 2 t matrix. The n individuals themselves may be divided and randomly assigned to g groups. Analysis of these data using a MANOVA model, assuming that the data on an individual has a covariance matrix which is a Kronecker product of two positive definite matrices, is considered. The well-known Satterthwaite type approximation to the distribution of a quadratic form in normal variables is extended to the distribution of a multivariate quadratic form in multivariate normal variables. The multivariate tests using this approximation are developed for testing the usual hypotheses. Results are illustrated on a data set. A method for analysing unbalanced data is also discussed.},

@inproceedings{WernerKronCov,
	Abstract = {The estimation of signal covariance matrices is a crucial part of many signal processing algorithms. In some applications, the structure of the problem suggests that the underlying, true, covariance matrix is the Kronecker product of two matrices. Examples of such problems are channel modelling for MIMO communications and signal modelling of EEG data. In applications it may also be that the Kronecker factors in turn can be assumed to possess additional, linear, structure. The maximum likelihood (ML) estimator for the problem has been proposed previously. It is asymptotically efficient but has the drawback of requiring an iterative search. Two methods that are both non-iterative and asymptotically efficient are proposed in this paper. The first method is derived from a well-known iterative maximization technique for the likelihood function. It performs on par with ML in simulations, but has the drawback of not allowing for extra structure in addition to the Kronecker structure. The second method is based on covariance matching principles, and does not suffer from this drawback. However, while the large sample performance is shown to be identical to ML, it performs somewhat worse in small samples than the first estimator. In addition, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB) for the problem is derived in a compact form.},

@article{Frazee06012014,
	Abstract = {RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is a flexible technology for measuring genome-wide expression that is rapidly replacing microarrays as costs become comparable. Current differential expression analysis methods for RNA-seq data fall into two broad classes: (1) methods that quantify expression within the boundaries of genes previously published in databases and (2) methods that attempt to reconstruct full length RNA transcripts. The first class cannot discover differential expression outside of previously known genes. While the second approach does possess discovery capabilities, statistical analysis of differential expression is complicated by the ambiguity and variability incurred while assembling transcripts and estimating their abundances. Here, we propose a novel method that first identifies differentially expressed regions (DERs) of interest by assessing differential expression at each base of the genome. The method then segments the genome into regions comprised of bases showing similar differential expression signal, and then assigns a measure of statistical significance to each region. Optionally, DERs can be annotated using a reference database of genomic features. We compare our approach with leading competitors from both current classes of differential expression methods and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each. A software implementation of our method is available on github (https://github.com/alyssafrazee/derfinder).},

	Abstract = {Abstract A novel homogeneity-based method for music structure analysis is proposed. The heart of the method is a similarity measure, derived from first principles, that is based on the matrix Elastic Net (EN) regularization and deals efficiently with highly correlated audio feature vectors. In particular, beat-synchronous mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, chroma features, and auditory temporal modulations model the audio signal. The EN induced similarity measure is employed to construct an affinity matrix, yielding a novel subspace clustering method referred to as Elastic Net subspace clustering (ENSC). The performance of the ENSC in structure analysis is assessed by conducting extensive experiments on the Beatles dataset. The experimental findings demonstrate the descriptive power of the EN-based affinity matrix over the affinity matrices employed in subspace clustering methods, attaining the state-of-the-art performance reported for the Beatles dataset.},

@article{Gunnemann:2013uq,
	Abstract = {Today's applications deal with multiple types of information: graph data to represent the relations between objects and attribute data to characterize single objects. Analyzing both data sources simultaneously can increase the quality of mining methods. Recently, combined clustering approaches were introduced, which detect densely connected node sets within one large graph that also show high similarity according to all of their attribute values. However, for attribute data it is known that this full-space clustering often leads to poor clustering results. Thus, subspace clustering was introduced to identify locally relevant subsets of attributes for each cluster. In this work, we propose a method for finding homogeneous groups by joining the paradigms of subspace clustering and dense sub graph mining, i.e. we determine sets of nodes that show high similarity in subsets of their dimensions and that are as well densely connected within the given graph. Our twofold clusters are optimized according to their density, size, and number of relevant dimensions. Our developed redundancy model confines the clustering to a manageable size of only the most interesting clusters. We introduce the algorithm Gamer for the efficient calculation of our clustering. In thorough experiments on synthetic and real world data we show that Gamer achieves low runtimes and high clustering qualities.},

@article{LiuLRTC,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we propose an algorithm to estimate missing values in tensors of visual data. The values can be missing due to problems in the acquisition process or because the user manually identified unwanted outliers. Our algorithm works even with a small amount of samples and it can propagate structure to fill larger missing regions. Our methodology is built on recent studies about matrix completion using the matrix trace norm. The contribution of our paper is to extend the matrix case to the tensor case by proposing the first definition of the trace norm for tensors and then by building a working algorithm. First, we propose a definition for the tensor trace norm that generalizes the established definition of the matrix trace norm. Second, similarly to matrix completion, the tensor completion is formulated as a convex optimization problem. Unfortunately, the straightforward problem extension is significantly harder to solve than the matrix case because of the dependency among multiple constraints. To tackle this problem, we developed three algorithms: simple low rank tensor completion (SiLRTC), fast low rank tensor completion (FaLRTC), and high accuracy low rank tensor completion (HaLRTC). The SiLRTC algorithm is simple to implement and employs a relaxation technique to separate the dependant relationships and uses the block coordinate descent (BCD) method to achieve a globally optimal solution; the FaLRTC algorithm utilizes a smoothing scheme to transform the original nonsmooth problem into a smooth one and can be used to solve a general tensor trace norm minimization problem; the HaLRTC algorithm applies the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) to our problem. Our experiments show potential applications of our algorithms and the quantitative evaluation indicates that our methods are more accurate and robust than heuristic approaches. The efficiency comparison indicates that FaLTRC and HaLRTC are more efficient than SiLRTC and between FaLRTC an- HaLRTC the former is more efficient to obtain a low accuracy solution and the latter is preferred if a high-accuracy solution is desired.},

Among the major challenges in analysis of metabolomics data are (i) joint analysis of data from multiple platforms and (ii) capturing easily interpretable underlying patterns, which could be further utilized for biomarker discovery. In order to address these challenges, we formulate joint analysis of data from multiple platforms as a coupled matrix factorization problem with sparsity constraints on the factor matrices. We develop an all-at-once optimization algorithm, called CMF-SPOPT (Coupled Matrix Factorization with SParse Optimization), which is a gradient-based optimization approach solving for all factor matrices simultaneously. Using numerical experiments on simulated data, we demonstrate that CMF-SPOPT can capture the underlying sparse patterns in data. Furthermore, on a real data set of blood samples collected from a group of rats, we use the proposed approach to jointly analyze metabolomic data sets and identify potential biomarkers for apple intake.},

	Abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title><p>Recent advances in DNA sequencing and metagenomics are opening a window into the human microbiome revealing novel associations between certain microbial consortia and disease. However, most of these studies are cross-sectional and lack a mechanistic understanding of this ecosystem's structure and its response to external perturbations, therefore not allowing accurate temporal predictions. In this article, we develop a method to analyze temporal community data accounting also for time-dependent external perturbations. In particular, this method combines the classical Lotka--Volterra model of population dynamics with regression techniques to obtain mechanistically descriptive coefficients which can be further used to construct predictive models of ecosystem dynamics. Using then data from a mouse experiment under antibiotic perturbations, we are able to predict and recover the microbiota temporal dynamics and study the concept of alternative stable states and antibiotic-induced transitions. As a result, our method reveals a group of commensal microbes that potentially protect against infection by the pathogen <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> and proposes a possible mechanism how the antibiotic makes the host more susceptible to infection.</p>},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a new class of tensor factorization called positive semidefinite tensor factorization (PSDTF) that decomposes a set of positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices into the convex combinations of fewer PSD basis matrices. PSDTF can be viewed as a natural extension of nonnegative matrix factorization. One of the main problems of PSDTF is that an appropriate number of bases should be given in advance. To solve this problem, we propose a nonparametric Bayesian model based on a gamma process that can instantiate only a limited number of necessary bases from the infinitely many bases assumed to exist. We derive a variational Bayesian algorithm for closed-form posterior inference and a multiplicative update rule for maximum-likelihood estimation. We evaluated PSDTF on both synthetic data and real music recordings to show its superiority.},

@article{Ponnapalli:2011fk,
	Abstract = {The number of high-dimensional datasets recording multiple aspects of a single phenomenon is increasing in many areas of science, accompanied by a need for mathematical frameworks that can compare multiple large-scale matrices with different row dimensions. The only such framework to date, the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD), is limited to two matrices. We mathematically define a higher-order GSVD (HO GSVD) for N>/=2 matrices D(i)inR(m(i) x n), each with full column rank. Each matrix is exactly factored as D(i)=U(i)Sigma(i)V(T), where V, identical in all factorizations, is obtained from the eigensystem SV=VLambda of the arithmetic mean S of all pairwise quotients A(i)A(j)(-1) of the matrices A(i)=D(i)(T)D(i), i not equalj. We prove that this decomposition extends to higher orders almost all of the mathematical properties of the GSVD. The matrix S is nondefective with V and Lambda real. Its eigenvalues satisfy lambda(k)>/=1. Equality holds if and only if the corresponding eigenvector v(k) is a right basis vector of equal significance in all matrices D(i) and D(j), that is sigma(i,k)/sigma(j,k)=1 for all i and j, and the corresponding left basis vector u(i,k) is orthogonal to all other vectors in U(i) for all i. The eigenvalues lambda(k)=1, therefore, define the "common HO GSVD subspace." We illustrate the HO GSVD with a comparison of genome-scale cell-cycle mRNA expression from S. pombe, S. cerevisiae and human. Unlike existing algorithms, a mapping among the genes of these disparate organisms is not required. We find that the approximately common HO GSVD subspace represents the cell-cycle mRNA expression oscillations, which are similar among the datasets. Simultaneous reconstruction in the common subspace, therefore, removes the experimental artifacts, which are dissimilar, from the datasets. In the simultaneous sequence-independent classification of the genes of the three organisms in this common subspace, genes of highly conserved sequences but significantly different cell-cycle peak times are correctly classified.},

We show that they are important tools for dimensionality reduction in higher-order signal processing. We discuss applications in independent component analysis, simultaneous matrix diagonalization and subspace variants of algorithms based on higher-order statistics. },

@techreport{munos:hal-00747575,
	Abstract = {{This work covers several aspects of the optimism in the face of uncertainty principle applied to large scale optimization problems under finite numerical budget. The initial motivation for the research reported here originated from the empirical success of the so-called Monte-Carlo Tree Search method popularized in computer-go and further extended to many other games as well as optimization and planning problems. Our objective is to contribute to the development of theoretical foundations of the field by characterizing the complexity of the underlying optimization problems and designing efficient algorithms with performance guarantees. The main idea presented here is that it is possible to decompose a complex decision making problem (such as an optimization problem in a large search space) into a sequence of elementary decisions, where each decision of the sequence is solved using a (stochastic) multi-armed bandit (simple mathematical model for decision making in stochastic environments). This so-called hierarchical bandit approach (where the reward observed by a bandit in the hierarchy is itself the return of another bandit at a deeper level) possesses the nice feature of starting the exploration by a quasi-uniform sampling of the space and then focusing progressively on the most promising area, at different scales, according to the evaluations observed so far, and eventually performing a local search around the global optima of the function. The performance of the method is assessed in terms of the optimality of the returned solution as a function of the number of function evaluations. Our main contribution to the field of function optimization is a class of hierarchical optimistic algorithms designed for general search spaces (such as metric spaces, trees, graphs, Euclidean spaces, ...) with different algorithmic instantiations depending on whether the evaluations are noisy or noiseless and whether some measure of the ''smoothness'' of the function is known or unknown. The performance of the algorithms depend on the local behavior of the function around its global optima expressed in terms of the quantity of near-optimal states measured with some metric. If this local smoothness of the function is known then one can design very efficient optimization algorithms (with convergence rate independent of the space dimension), and when it is not known, we can build adaptive techniques that can, in some cases, perform almost as well as when it is known.}},

@article{Cummings01082003,
	Abstract = {Assessment of the reliability of a given phylogenetic hypothesis is an important step in phylogenetic analysis. Historically, the nonparametric bootstrap procedure has been the most frequently used method for assessing the support for specific phylogenetic relationships. The recent employment of Bayesian methods for phylogenetic inference problems has resulted in clade support being expressed in terms of posterior probabilities. We used simulated data and the four-taxon case to explore the relationship between nonparametric bootstrap values (as inferred by maximum likelihood) and posterior probabilities (as inferred by Bayesian analysis). The results suggest a complex association between the two measures. Three general regions of tree space can be identified: (1) the neutral zone, where differences between mean bootstrap and mean posterior probability values are not significant, (2) near the two-branch corner, and (3) deep in the two-branch corner. In the last two regions, significant differences occur between mean bootstrap and mean posterior probability values. Whether bootstrap or posterior probability values are higher depends on the data in support of alternative topologies. Examination of star topologies revealed that both bootstrap and posterior probability values differ significantly from theoretical expectations; in particular, there are more posterior probability values in the range 0.85--1 than expected by theory. Therefore, our results corroborate the findings of others that posterior probability values are excessively high. Our results also suggest that extrapolations from single topology branch-length studies are unlikely to provide any general conclusions regarding the relationship between bootstrap and posterior probability values.},

@article{MillerApplied,
	Abstract = {{Phylogenetic relationships among members of the family Gyrinidae
   (Coleoptera: Adephaga) were inferred from analysis of 42 morphological
   characters and DNA sequence data from the genes 12S rRNA, cytochrome c
   oxidase I and II, elongation factor 1 alpha (2 different copies) and
   histone III. Eighty-nine species of Gyrinidae were included representing
   all known subfamilies, tribes and genera. Outgroups include species from
   Noteridae, Paelobiidae and Dytiscidae. Analyses include parsimony
   analysis, and partitioned time-free and relaxed-clock Bayesian analyses
   of the combined data using reversible-jump MCMC to simultaneously
   integrate over all possible 4 X 4 nucleotide substitution models.
   Analyses resulted in conflicting topologies between the combined
   parsimony and Bayesian analyses on the one hand, and the relaxed-clock
   analysis on the other. The marginal likelihoods of competing models were
   calculated with stepping-stone sampling and used in a Bayes factor test,
   which, along with arguments from morphology, supported the topology
   generated by the relaxed-clock analysis. This phylogenetic hypothesis is
   adopted to revise the higher classification of Gyrinidae. Major
   taxonomic conclusions include: (i) monophyletic Gyrinidae, (ii) the
   Nearctic Spanglerogyrinae Folkerts (with one species, Spanglerogyrus
   albiventris Folkerts) sister to all other Gyrinidae, (iii) the
   Madagascar endemic Heterogyrinae Brinck stat. n. (with one species,
   Heterogyrus milloti Legros) sister to all Gyrinidae except
   Spanglerogyrinae, (iv) monophyletic Gyrininae Latreille including three
   monophyletic tribes with the following relationship: Orectochilini
   Regimbart + (Gyrinini Latreille + Enhydrini Regimbart), (v) monophyletic
   Orectochilini comprising four monophyletic genera with the following
   relationships: (Gyretes Brulle + Patrus Aubestat. n.) + (Orectogyrus
   Regimbart + Orectochilus Dejean), (vi) monophyletic Gyrinini comprising
   three genera with the following relationships: Gyrinus Geoffroy +
   (Metagyrinus Brinck + Aulonogyrus Motschulsky), each monophyletic except
   Metagyrinus with only one included species and not tested for monophyly,
   and (vii) monophyletic Enhydrini comprising five genera with the
   following relationships: (Porrorhynchus Laporte + Dineutus MacLeay) +
   (Enhydrus Laporte + (Andogyrus Ochs + Macrogyrus Regimbart)), each
   monophyletic except Porrorhynchus, Enhydrus and Andogyrus each with one
   included species and untested for monophyly. Each subfamily, tribe and

	Abstract = {{The rapidly growing availability of multigene sequence data during the
   past decade has enabled phylogeny estimation at phylogenomic scales.
   However, dealing with evolutionary process heterogeneity across the
   genome becomes increasingly challenging. Here we develop a mixture model
   approach that uses reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
   estimation to permit as many distinct models as the data require. Each
   additional model considered may be a fully parametrized general
   time-reversible model or any of its special cases. Furthermore, we
   expand the usual proposal mechanisms for topology changes to permit hard
   polytomies (i.e., zero-length internal branches). This new approach is
   implemented in the Crux software toolkit. We demonstrate the feasibility
   of using reversible jump MCMC on mixture models by reexamining a
   well-known 44-taxon mammalian data set comprising 22 concatenated genes.
   We are able to reproduce the results of the original analysis (with
   respect to bipartition support) when we make identical assumptions, but
   when we allow for polytomies and/or use data-driven mixture model
   estimation, we infer much lower bipartition support values for several
   key bipartitions.}},

@article{Arima2012,
	Abstract = {{Bayesian phylogenetic methods are generating noticeable enthusiasm in
   the field of molecular systematics. Many phylogenetic models are often
   at stake, and different approaches are used to compare them within a
   Bayesian framework. The Bayes factor, defined as the ratio of the
   marginal likelihoods of two competing models, plays a key role in
   Bayesian model selection. We focus on an alternative estimator of the
   marginal likelihood whose computation is still a challenging problem.
   Several computational solutions have been proposed, none of which can be
   considered outperforming the others simultaneously in terms of
   simplicity of implementation, computational burden and precision of the
   estimates. Practitioners and researchers, often led by available
   software, have privileged so far the simplicity of the harmonic mean
   (HM) estimator. However, it is known that the resulting estimates of the
   Bayesian evidence in favor of one model are biased and often inaccurate,
   up to having an infinite variance so that the reliability of the
   corresponding conclusions is doubtful. We consider possible improvements
   of the generalized harmonic mean (GHM) idea that recycle Markov Chain
   Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations from the posterior, share the
   computational simplicity of the original HM estimator, but, unlike it,
   overcome the infinite variance issue. We show reliability and
   comparative performance of the improved harmonic mean estimators
   comparing them to approximation techniques relying on improved variants
   of the thermodynamic integration.}},

@article{RonquistMrBayes3.2,
	Abstract = {{Since its introduction in 2001, MrBayes has grown in popularity as a
   software package for Bayesian phylogenetic inference using Markov chain
   Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. With this note, we announce the release of
   version 3.2, a major upgrade to the latest official release presented in
   2003. The new version provides convergence diagnostics and allows
   multiple analyses to be run in parallel with convergence progress
   monitored on the fly. The introduction of new proposals and automatic
   optimization of tuning parameters has improved convergence for many
   problems. The new version also sports significantly faster likelihood
   calculations through streaming single-instruction-multiple-data
   extensions (SSE) and support of the BEAGLE library, allowing likelihood
   calculations to be delegated to graphics processing units (GPUs) on
   compatible hardware. Speedup factors range from around 2 with SSE code
   to more than 50 with BEAGLE for codon problems. Checkpointing across all
   models allows long runs to be completed even when an analysis is
   prematurely terminated. New models include relaxed clocks, dating, model
   averaging across time-reversible substitution models, and support for
   hard, negative, and partial (backbone) tree constraints. Inference of
   species trees from gene trees is supported by full incorporation of the
   Bayesian estimation of species trees (BEST) algorithms. Marginal model
   likelihoods for Bayes factor tests can be estimated accurately across
   the entire model space using the stepping stone method. The new version
   provides more output options than previously, including samples of
   ancestral states, site rates, site d(N)/d(S) rations, branch rates, and
   node dates. A wide range of statistics on tree parameters can also be
   output for visualization in FigTree and compatible software.}},

@article{Wu2dPAGE,
	Abstract = {{Background: Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D PAGE)
   is commonly used to identify differentially expressed proteins under two
   or more experimental or observational conditions. Wu et al (2009)
   developed a univariate probabilistic model which was used to identify
   differential expression between Case and Control groups, by applying a
   Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) to each protein on a 2D PAGE. In contrast to
   commonly used statistical approaches, this model takes into account the
   two possible causes of missing values in 2D PAGE: either (1) the
   non-expression of a protein; or (2) a level of expression that falls
   below the limit of detection.
   Results: We develop a global Bayesian model which extends the previously
   described model. Unlike the univariate approach, the model reported here
   is able treat all differentially expressed proteins simultaneously.
   Whereas each protein is modelled by the univariate likelihood function
   previously described, several global distributions are used to model the
   underlying relationship between the parameters associated with
   individual proteins. These global distributions are able to combine
   information from each protein to give more accurate estimates of the
   true parameters. In our implementation of the procedure, all parameters
   are recovered by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration. The 95\%
   highest posterior density (HPD) intervals for the marginal posterior
   distributions are used to determine whether differences in protein
   expression are due to differences in mean expression intensities, and/or
   differences in the probabilities of expression.
   Conclusions: Simulation analyses showed that the global model is able to
   accurately recover the underlying global distributions, and identify
   more differentially expressed proteins than the simple application of a
   LRT. Additionally, simulations also indicate that the probability of
   incorrectly identifying a protein as differentially expressed (i.e., the
   False Discovery Rate) is very low. The source code is available at

@article{SMCphylo,
	Abstract = {{Bayesian inference provides an appealing general framework for
   phylogenetic analysis, able to incorporate a wide variety of modeling
   assumptions and to provide a coherent treatment of uncertainty. Existing
   computational approaches to Bayesian inference based on Markov chain
   Monte Carlo (MCMC) have not, however, kept pace with the scale of the
   data analysis problems in phylogenetics, and this has hindered the
   adoption of Bayesian methods. In this paper, we present an alternative
   to MCMC based on Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). We develop an extension
   of classical SMC based on partially ordered sets and show how to apply
   this framework-which we refer to as PosetSMC-to phylogenetic analysis.
   We provide a theoretical treatment of PosetSMC and also present
   experimental evaluation of PosetSMC on both synthetic and real data. The
   empirical results demonstrate that PosetSMC is a very promising
   alternative to MCMC, providing up to two orders of magnitude faster
   convergence. We discuss other factors favorable to the adoption of
   PosetSMC in phylogenetics, including its ability to estimate marginal
   likelihoods, its ready implementability on parallel and distributed
   computing platforms, and the possibility of combining with MCMC in
   hybrid MCMC-SMC schemes. Software for PosetSMC is available at

@article{phyloInform,
	Abstract = {{Phylogenetic research is often stymied by selection of a marker that
   leads to poor phylogenetic resolution despite considerable cost and
   effort. Profiles of phylogenetic informativeness provide a quantitative
   measure for prioritizing gene sampling to resolve branching order in a
   particular epoch. To evaluate the utility of these profiles, we analyzed
   phylogenomic data sets from metazoans, fungi, and mammals, thus
   encompassing diverse time scales and taxonomic groups. We also evaluated
   the utility of profiles created based on simulated data sets. We found
   that genes selected via their informativeness dramatically outperformed
   haphazard sampling of markers. Furthermore, our analyses demonstrate
   that the original phylogenetic informativeness method can be extended to
   trees with more than four taxa. Thus, although the method currently
   predicts phylogenetic signal without specifically accounting for the
   misleading effects of stochastic noise, it is robust to the effects of
   homoplasy. The phylogenetic informativeness rankings obtained will allow
   other researchers to select advantageous genes for future studies within
   these clades, maximizing return on effort and investment. Genes
   identified might also yield efficient experimental designs for
   phylogenetic inference for many sister clades and outgroup taxa that are
   closely related to the diverse groups of organisms analyzed.}},

@article{BergstenTopologyHyp,
	Abstract = {{We review Bayesian approaches to model testing in general and to the
   assessment of topological hypotheses in particular. We show that the
   standard way of setting up Bayes factor tests of the monophyly of a
   group, or the placement of a sample sequence in a known reference tree,
   can be misleading. The reason for this is related to the well-known
   dependency of Bayes factors on model-specific priors. Specifically, when
   testing tree hypotheses it is important that each hypothesis is
   associated with an appropriate tree space in the prior. This can be
   achieved by using appropriately constrained searches or by filtering
   trees in the posterior sample, but in a more elaborate way than
   typically implemented. If it is difficult to find the appropriate tree
   sets to be contrasted, then the posterior model odds may be more
   informative than the Bayes factor. We illustrate the recommended
   techniques using an empirical test case addressing the issue of whether
   two genera of diving beetles (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae), Suphrodytes and
   Hydroporus, should be synonymized. Our refined Bayes factor tests, in
   contrast to standard analyses, show that there is strong support for
   Suphrodytes nesting inside Hydroporus, and the genera are therefore
   synonymized.}},

	Abstract = {{MrBayes, using Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMCMC or
   (MC)(3)), is a popular program for Bayesian inference. As a leading
   method of using DNA data to infer phylogeny, the (MC)(3) Bayesian
   algorithm and its improved and parallel versions are now not fast enough
   for biologists to analyze massive real-world DNA data. Recently,
   graphics processor unit (GPU) has shown its power as a coprocessor (or
   rather, an accelerator) in many fields. This article describes an
   efficient implementation a(MC)(3) (aMCMCMC) for MrBayes (MC)(3) on
   compute unified device architecture. By dynamically adjusting the task
   granularity to adapt to input data size and hardware configuration, it
   makes full use of GPU cores with different data sets. An adaptive method
   is also developed to split and combine DNA sequences to make full use of
   a large number of GPU cards. Furthermore, a new ``node-by-node{''} task
   scheduling strategy is developed to improve concurrency, and several
   optimizing methods are used to reduce extra overhead. Experimental
   results show that a(MC)(3) achieves up to 63x speedup over serial
   MrBayes on a single machine with one GPU card, and up to 170x speedup
   with four GPU cards, and up to 478x speedup with a 32-node GPU cluster.
   a(MC)(3) is dramatically faster than all the previous (MC)(3) algorithms
   and scales well to large GPU clusters.}},

@article{lingMC3gpu,
	Abstract = {{MrBayes is model-based phylogenetic inference tool using Bayesian
   statistics. However, model-based assessment of phylogenetic trees adds
   to the computational burden of tree-searching, and so poses significant
   computational challenges. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have been
   proposed as high performance, low cost acceleration platforms and
   several parallelized versions of the Metropolis Coupled Markov Chain
   Mote Carlo (MC3) algorithm in MrBayes have been presented that can run
   on GPUs. However, some bottlenecks decrease the efficiency of these
   implementations. To address these bottlenecks, we propose a tight GPU
   MC3 (tgMC(3)) algorithm. tgMC(3) implements a different architecture
   from the one-to-one acceleration architecture employed in previously
   proposed methods. It merges multiply discrete GPU kernels according to
   the data dependency and hence decreases the number of kernels launched
   and the complexity of data transfer. We implemented tgMC(3) and made
   performance comparisons with an earlier proposed algorithm, nMC(3), and
   also with MrBayes MC3 under serial and multiply concurrent CPU
   processes. All of the methods were benchmarked on the same computing
   node from DEGIMA. Experiments indicate that the tgMC(3) method outstrips
   nMC(3) (v1.0) with speedup factors from 2.1 to 2.7x. In addition,
   tgMC(3) outperforms the serial MrBayes MC3 by a factor of 6 to 30x when
   using a single GTX480 card, whereas a speedup factor of around 51x can
   be achieved by using two GTX 480 cards on relatively long sequences.
   Moreover, tgMC(3) was compared with MrBayes accelerated by BEAGLE, and
   achieved speedup factors from 3.7 to 5.7x. The reported performance
   improvement of tgMC(3) is significant and appears to scale well with
   increasing dataset sizes. In addition, the strategy proposed in tgMC(3)
   could benefit the acceleration of other Bayesian-based phylogenetic
   analysis methods using GPUs.}},

@article{Altekar12022004,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Bayesian estimation of phylogeny is based on the posterior probability distribution of trees. Currently, the only numerical method that can effectively approximate posterior probabilities of trees is Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Standard implementations of MCMC can be prone to entrapment in local optima. Metropolis coupled MCMC [(MC)3], a variant of MCMC, allows multiple peaks in the landscape of trees to be more readily explored, but at the cost of increased execution time.Results: This paper presents a parallel algorithm for (MC)3. The proposed parallel algorithm retains the ability to explore multiple peaks in the posterior distribution of trees while maintaining a fast execution time. The algorithm has been implemented using two popular parallel programming models: message passing and shared memory. Performance results indicate nearly linear speed improvement in both programming models for small and large data sets.Availability: MrBayes v3.0 is available at http://morphbank.ebc.uu.se/mrbayes/},

	Abstract = {While clustering is usually an unsupervised operation, there are circumstances in which we believe (with varying degrees of certainty) that items A and B should be assigned to the same cluster, while items A and C should not. We would like such pairwise relations to influence cluster assignments of out-of-sample data in a manner consistent with the prior knowledge expressed in the training set. Our starting point is probabilistic clustering based on gaussian mixture models (GMM) of the data distribution. We express clustering preferences in a prior distribution over assignments of data points to clusters. This prior penalizes cluster assignments according to the degree with which they violate the preferences. The model parameters are fit with the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Our model provides a flexible framework that encompasses several other semisupervised clustering models as its special cases. Experiments on artificial and real-world problems show that our model can consistently improve clustering results when pairwise relations are incorporated. The experiments also demonstrate the superiority of our model to other semisupervised clustering methods on handling noisy pairwise relations.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we cast natural-image segmentation as a problem of clustering texure features as multivariate mixed data. We model the distribution of the texture features using a mixture of Gaussian distributions. However, unlike most existing clustering methods, we allow the mixture components to be degenerate or nearly-degenerate. We contend that this assumption is particularly important for mid-level image segmentation, where degeneracy is typically introduced by using a common feature representation for different textures. We show that such a mixture distribution can be effectively segmented by a simple agglomerative clustering algorithm derived from a lossy data compression approach. Using simple fixed-size Gaussian windows as texture features, the algorithm segments an image by minimizing the overall coding length of all the feature vectors. In terms of a variety of performance indices, our algorithm compares favorably against other well-known image segmentation methods on the Berkeley image database.},

Although the method uses the Bayesian framework and exploits the computational simplicity of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, it provides valid frequentist inferences such as the maximum likelihood estimates and their standard errors. The inferences are completely invariant to the choice of the prior distributions and therefore avoid the inherent subjectivity of the Bayesian approach. The data cloning method is easily implemented using standard MCMC software. Data cloning is particularly useful for analysing ecological situations in which hierarchical statistical models, such as state-space models and mixed effects models, are appropriate. We illustrate the method by fitting two nonlinear population dynamics models to data in the presence of process and observation noise.},

@article{Ponciano2012,
	Abstract = {{The success of model-based methods in phylogenetics has motivated much
   research aimed at generating new, biologically informative models. This
   new computer-intensive approach to phylogenetics demands validation
   studies and sound measures of performance. To date there has been little
   practical guidance available as to when and why the parameters in a
   particular model can be identified reliably. Here, we illustrate how
   Data Cloning (DC), a recently developed methodology to compute the
   maximum likelihood estimates along with their asymptotic variance, can
   be used to diagnose structural parameter nonidentifiability (NI) and
   distinguish it from other parameter estimability problems, including
   when parameters are structurally identifiable, but are not estimable in
   a given data set (INE), and when parameters are identifiable, and
   estimable, but only weakly so (WE). The application of the DC theorem
   uses well-known and widely used Bayesian computational techniques. With
   the DC approach, practitioners can use Bayesian phylogenetics software
   to diagnose nonidentifiability. Theoreticians and practitioners alike
   now have a powerful, yet simple tool to detect nonidentifiability while
   investigating complex modeling scenarios, where getting closed-form
   expressions in a probabilistic study is complicated. Furthermore, here
   we also show how DC can be used as a tool to examine and eliminate the
   influence of the priors, in particular if the process of prior
   elicitation is not straightforward. Finally, when applied to
   phylogenetic inference, DC can be used to study at least two important
   statistical questions: assessing identifiability of discrete parameters,
   like the tree topology, and developing efficient sampling methods for
   computationally expensive posterior densities.}},

   paper, we propose the geodesic distance as an effective tool for
   exploring the likelihood profile in the space of phylogenetic trees, and
   we give a cubic time algorithm, GEOHEURISTIC, in order to compute an
   approximation of the distance. We compare it with the GTP algorithm,
   which calculates the exact distance, and the cone path length, which is
   another approximation, showing that GEOHEURISTIC achieves a quite good
   trade-off between accuracy (relative error always lower than 0.0001) and
   efficiency. We also prove the equivalence among GEOHEURISTIC, cone path,
   and Robinson-Foulds distances when assuming branch lengths equal to
   unity and we show empirically that, under this restriction, these
   distances are almost always equal to the actual geodesic.}},

@article{TREECA,
	Abstract = {{Phylogenetic analysis of DNA or other data commonly gives rise to a
   collection or sample of inferred evolutionary trees. Principal
   Components Analysis (PCA) cannot be applied directly to collections of
   trees since the space of evolutionary trees on a fixed set of taxa is
   not a vector space. This paper describes a novel geometrical approach to
   PCA in tree-space that constructs the first principal path in an
   analogous way to standard linear Euclidean PCA. Given a data set of
   phylogenetic trees, a geodesic principal path is sought that maximizes
   the variance of the data under a form of projection onto the path. Due
   to the high dimensionality of tree-space and the nonlinear nature of
   this problem, the computational complexity is potentially very high, so
   approximate optimization algorithms are used to search for the optimal
   path. Principal paths identified in this way reveal and quantify the
   main sources of variation in the original collection of trees in terms
   of both topology and branch lengths. The approach is illustrated by
   application to simulated sets of trees and to a set of gene trees from
   metazoan (animal) species.}},

@article{Chakerian2012,
	Abstract = {{Inferential summaries of tree estimates are useful in the setting of
   evolutionary biology, where phylogenetic trees have been built from DNA
   data since the 1960s. In bioinformatics, psychometrics, and data mining,
   hierarchical clustering techniques output the same mathematical objects,
   and practitioners have similar questions about the stability and
   ``generalizability{''} of these summaries. This article describes the
   implementation of the geometric distance between trees developed by
   Billera, Holmes, and Vogtmann (2001) equally applicable to phylogenetic
   trees and hierarchical clustering trees, and shows some of the
   applications in evaluating tree estimates.
   In particular, since Billera et al. (2001) have shown that the space of
   trees is negatively curved (called a CAT(0) space), a collection of
   trees can naturally be represented as a tree. We compare this
   representation to the Euclidean approximations of treespace made
   available through both a classical multidimensional scaling and a Kernel
   multidimensional scaling of the matrix of the distances between trees.
   We also provide applications of the distances between trees to
   hierarchical clustering trees constructed from microarrays. Our method
   gives a new way of evaluating the influence of both certain columns
   (positions, variables, or genes) and certain rows (species,
   observations, or arrays) on the construction of such trees. It also can
   provide a way of detecting heterogeneous mixtures in the input data.
   Supplementary materials for this article are available online.}},

@article{CardonaCophenetic,
	Abstract = {{Background: Phylogenetic tree comparison metrics are an important tool
   in the study of evolution, and hence the definition of such metrics is
   an interesting problem in phylogenetics. In a paper in Taxon fifty years
   ago, Sokal and Rohlf proposed to measure quantitatively the difference
   between a pair of phylogenetic trees by first encoding them by means of
   their half-matrices of cophenetic values, and then comparing these
   matrices. This idea has been used several times since then to define
   dissimilarity measures between phylogenetic trees but, to our knowledge,
   no proper metric on weighted phylogenetic trees with nested taxa based
   on this idea has been formally defined and studied yet. Actually, the
   cophenetic values of pairs of different taxa alone are not enough to
   single out phylogenetic trees with weighted arcs or nested taxa.
   Results: For every (rooted) phylogenetic tree T, let its cophenetic
   vector phi(T) consist of all pairs of cophenetic values between pairs of
   taxa in T and all depths of taxa in T. It turns out that these
   cophenetic vectors single out weighted phylogenetic trees with nested
   taxa. We then define a family of cophenetic metrics d(phi,p) by
   comparing these cophenetic vectors by means of L-p norms, and we study,
   either analytically or numerically, some of their basic properties:
   neighbors, diameter, distribution, and their rank correlation with each
   other and with other metrics.
   Conclusions: The cophenetic metrics can be safely used on weighted
   phylogenetic trees with nested taxa and no restriction on degrees, and
   they can be computed in O(n(2)) time, where n stands for the number of
   taxa. The metrics d(phi,1) and d(phi,2) have positive skewed
   distributions, and they show a low rank correlation with the
   Robinson-Foulds metric and the nodal metrics, and a very high
   correlation with each other and with the splitted nodal metrics. The
   diameter of d(phi,p), for p >= 1, is in O(n((p+2)/p)), and thus for low
   p they are more discriminative, having a wider range of values.}},

	Abstract = {We built whole-genome trees based on the presence or absence of particular molecular features, either orthologs or folds, in the genomes of a number of recently sequenced microorganisms. To put these genomic trees into perspective, we compared them to the traditional ribosomal phylogeny and also to trees based on the sequence similarity of individual orthologous proteins. We found that our genomic trees based on the overall occurrence of orthologs did not agree well with the traditional tree. This discrepancy, however, vanished when one restricted the tree to proteins involved in transcription and translation, not including problematic proteins involved in metabolism. Protein folds unite superficially unrelated sequence families and represent a most fundamental molecular unit described by genomes. We found that our genomic occurrence tree based on folds agreed fairly well with the traditional ribosomal phylogeny. Surprisingly, despite this overall agreement, certain classes of folds, particularly all-beta ones, had a somewhat different phylogenetic distribution. We also compared our occurrence trees to whole-genome clusters based on the composition of amino acids and di-nucleotides. Finally, we analyzed some technical aspects of genomic trees-e.g., comparing parsimony versus distance-based approaches and examining the effects of increasing numbers of organisms. Additional information (e.g. clickable trees) is available from http://bioinfo.mbb.yale.edu/genome/trees.},

	Abstract = {Network analysis has been applied widely, providing a unifying language to describe disparate systems ranging from social interactions to power grids. It has recently been used in molecular biology, but so far the resulting networks have only been analysed statically. Here we present the dynamics of a biological network on a genomic scale, by integrating transcriptional regulatory information and gene-expression data for multiple conditions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We develop an approach for the statistical analysis of network dynamics, called SANDY, combining well-known global topological measures, local motifs and newly derived statistics. We uncover large changes in underlying network architecture that are unexpected given current viewpoints and random simulations. In response to diverse stimuli, transcription factors alter their interactions to varying degrees, thereby rewiring the network. A few transcription factors serve as permanent hubs, but most act transiently only during certain conditions. By studying sub-network structures, we show that environmental responses facilitate fast signal propagation (for example, with short regulatory cascades), whereas the cell cycle and sporulation direct temporal progression through multiple stages (for example, with highly inter-connected transcription factors). Indeed, to drive the latter processes forward, phase-specific transcription factors inter-regulate serially, and ubiquitously active transcription factors layer above them in a two-tiered hierarchy. We anticipate that many of the concepts presented here--particularly the large-scale topological changes and hub transience--will apply to other biological networks, including complex sub-systems in higher eukaryotes.},

	Abstract = {<p>Pathway analysis has become the first choice for gaining insight into the underlying biology of differentially expressed genes and proteins, as it reduces complexity and has increased explanatory power. We discuss the evolution of knowledge base--driven pathway analysis over its first decade, distinctly divided into three generations. We also discuss the limitations that are specific to each generation, and how they are addressed by successive generations of methods. We identify a number of annotation challenges that must be addressed to enable development of the next generation of pathway analysis methods. Furthermore, we identify a number of methodological challenges that the next generation of methods must tackle to take advantage of the technological advances in genomics and proteomics in order to improve specificity, sensitivity, and relevance of pathway analysis.</p>},

	Abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms play a key role in the Bayesian
approach to phylogenetic inference. In this paper, we present the first theoretical work analyzing the rate of convergence of several Markov chains widely
used in phylogenetic inference. We analyze simple, realistic examples where
these Markov chains fail to converge quickly. In particular, the data studied are generated from a pair of trees, under a standard evolutionary model.
We prove that many of the popular Markov chains take exponentially long to

known that phylogenetic trees for genes may differ within a single organism.

	Abstract = {Estimating covariance matrices is an important part of portfolio selection, risk management, and asset pricing. This paper reviews the recent development in estimating high dimensional covariance matrices, where the number of variables can be greater than the number of observations. The limitations of the sample covariance matrix are discussed. Several new approaches are presented, including the shrinkage method, the observable and latent factor method, the Bayesian approach, and the random matrix theory approach. For each method, the construction of covariance matrices is given. The relationships among these methods are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) can be seen as a singular value decomposition (SVD) of a column-centred data matrix. In a number of applications, no pre-processing of the data is carried out, and it is the uncentred data matrix that is subjected to an SVD, in what is often called an uncentred PCA. This paper explores the relationships between the results from both the standard, column-centred, PCA, and its uncentred counterpart. In particular, it obtains both exact results and bounds relating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariation matrices, as well as the principal components, in both types of analysis. These relationships highlight how the eigenvalues of both the covariance matrix and the matrix of non-central second moments contain much information that is highly informative for a comparative assessment of PCA and its uncentred variant. The relations and the examples also suggest that the results of both types of PCA have more in common than might be supposed.

	Abstract = {Temporal profiles of transcript abundance during embryonic development were obtained by whole-genome expression analysis from precisely staged C. elegans embryos. The result is a highly resolved time course that commences with the zygote and extends into mid-gastrulation, spanning the transition from maternal to embryonic control of development and including the presumptive specification of most major cell fates. Transcripts for nearly half (8890) of the predicted open reading frames are detected and expression levels for the majority of them (>70%) change over time. The transcriptome is stable up to the four-cell stage where it begins rapidly changing until the rate of change plateaus before gastrulation. At gastrulation temporal patterns of maternal degradation and embryonic expression intersect indicating a mid-blastula transition from maternal to embryonic control of development. In addition, we find that embryonic genes tend to be expressed transiently on a time scale consistent with developmental decisions being made with each cell cycle. Furthermore, overall rates of synthesis and degradation are matched such that the transcriptome maintains a steady-state frequency distribution. Finally, a versatile analytical platform based on cluster analysis and developmental classification of genes is provided.},

Using oligonucleotide microarrays, the expression levels of 6,817 genes were measured in a panel of 60 human cancer cell lines (the NCI-60) for which the chemosensitivity profiles of thousands of chemical compounds have been determined. We sought to determine whether the gene expression signatures of untreated cells were sufficient for the prediction of chemosensitivity. Gene expression-based classifiers of sensitivity or resistance for 232 compounds were generated and then evaluated on independent sets of data. The classifiers were designed to be independent of the cells' tissue of origin. The accuracy of chemosensitivity prediction was considerably better than would be expected by chance. Eighty-eight of 232 expression-based classifiers performed accurately (with P < 0.05) on an independent test set, whereas only 12 of the 232 would be expected to do so by chance. These results suggest that at least for a subset of compounds genomic approaches to chemosensitivity prediction are feasible.},

Here, a generic approach to cancer classification based on gene expression monitoring by DNA microarrays is described and applied to human acute leukemias as a test case. A class discovery procedure automatically discovered the distinction between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) without previous knowledge of these classes. An automatically derived class predictor was able to determine the class of new leukemia cases. The results demonstrate the feasibility of cancer classification based solely on gene expression monitoring and suggest a general strategy for discovering and predicting cancer classes for other types of cancer, independent of previous biological knowledge.},

Coupled with a model selection mechanism, adapted to work for any stochastic clustering algorithm, NMF is an efficient method for identification of distinct molecular patterns and provides a powerful method for class discovery. We demonstrate the ability of NMF to recover meaningful biological information from cancer-related microarray data. NMF appears to have advantages over other methods such as hierarchical clustering or self-organizing maps. We found it less sensitive to a priori selection of genes or initial conditions and able to detect alternative or context-dependent patterns of gene expression in complex biological systems. This ability, similar to semantic polysemy in text, provides a general method for robust molecular pattern discovery.},

@article{Dalton:2009kx,
	Abstract = {The development of microarray technology has enabled scientists to measure the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously, resulting in a surge of interest in several disciplines throughout biology and medicine. While data clustering has been used for decades in image processing and pattern recognition, in recent years it has joined this wave of activity as a popular technique to analyze microarrays. To illustrate its application to genomics, clustering applied to genes from a set of microarray data groups together those genes whose expression levels exhibit similar behavior throughout the samples, and when applied to samples it offers the potential to discriminate pathologies based on their differential patterns of gene expression. Although clustering has now been used for many years in the context of gene expression microarrays, it has remained highly problematic. The choice of a clustering algorithm and validation index is not a trivial one, more so when applying them to high throughput biological or medical data. Factors to consider when choosing an algorithm include the nature of the application, the characteristics of the objects to be analyzed, the expected number and shape of the clusters, and the complexity of the problem versus computational power available. In some cases a very simple algorithm may be appropriate to tackle a problem, but many situations may require a more complex and powerful algorithm better suited for the job at hand. In this paper, we will cover the theoretical aspects of clustering, including error and learning, followed by an overview of popular clustering algorithms and classical validation indices. We also discuss the relative performance of these algorithms and indices and conclude with examples of the application of clustering to computational biology.},

	Annote = {Since its introduction in 1974 by Ahmed et al., the discrete cosine transform (DCT) has become a significant tool in many areas of digital signal processing, especially in signal compression. There exist eight types of discrete cosine transforms (DCTs). We obtain the eight types of DCTs as the complete orthonormal set of eigenvectors generated by a general form of matrices in the same way as the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) can be obtained as the eigenvectors of an arbitrary circulant matrix. These matrices can be decomposed as the sum of a symmetric Toeplitz matrix plus a Hankel or close to Hankel matrix scaled by some constant factors. We also show that all the previously proposed generating matrices for the DCTs are simply particular cases of these general matrix forms. Using these matrices, we obtain, for each DCT, a class of stationary processes verifying certain conditions with respect to which the corresponding DCT has a good asymptotic behavior in the sense that it approaches Karhunen-Loeve transform performance as the block size N tends to infinity. As a particular result, we prove that the eight types of DCTs are asymptotically optimal for all finite-order Markov processes. We finally study the decorrelating power of the DCTs, obtaining expressions that show the decorrelating behavior of each DCT with respect to any stationary processes},

@article{Strang:1999fk,
	Annote = {Each discrete cosine transform (DCT) uses N real basis vectors whose components are cosines. In the DCT-4, for example, the jth component of v$_{k}$ is cos(j + 1/2)(k + 1/2)π/N. These basis vectors are orthogonal and the transform is extremely useful in image processing. If the vector x gives the intensities along a row of pixels, its cosine series Σc$_{k}$v$_{k}$ has the coefficients c$_{k}$ = (x, v$_{k}$)/N. They are quickly computed from a Fast Fourier Transform. But a direct proof of orthogonality, by calculating inner products, does not reveal how natural these cosine vectors are. We prove orthogonality in a different way. Each DCT basis contains the eigenvectors of a symmetric "second difference" matrix. By varying the boundary conditions we get the established transforms DCT-1 through DCT-4. Other combinations lead to four additional cosine transforms. The type of boundary condition (Dirichlet or Neumann, centered at a meshpoint or a midpoint) determines the applications that are appropriate for each transform. The centering also determines the period: N - 1 or N in the established transforms, N - 1/2 or N + 1/2 in the other four. The key point is that all these "eigenvectors of cosines" come from simple and familiar matrices.},
